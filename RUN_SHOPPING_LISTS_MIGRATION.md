# Shopping Lists table

To use **Shopping List** (create lists with title and bullet items, filter by department), create the table in Supabase:

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** → your project → **SQL Editor**.
2. Run the migration: **`supabase/migrations/CREATE_SHOPPING_LISTS_TABLE.sql`**.

After this, the Shopping List screen will load and save lists per vessel.
